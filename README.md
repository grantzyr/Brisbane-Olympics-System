# Brisbane Olympics System

## Logging In 
The first form a user is presented with when starting  the BOS system is Login. A user  (Olympics sporting official) enters their  username and password to be validated prior to successfully log in to the system.  Once logged in, the user is taken to the  Olympics Events List page to view their associated  events for the various Olympics sports.

## Viewing Events List 
Once a user has logged in, they are shown a list of all their associated events. This events list was ordered by sport name. Each event has an event name, sport name, and may or may not  have  a  sporting  official  assigned  as  a  referee,  judge,  and  medal  giver.  An  event  is  associated  with  a sporting official if the official is recorded as either the referee, judge, or medal giver. 

## Finding Events 
A user can search through all events by entering a word or phrase (a ‘keyword’) in the field next to the Find button, and then clicking on Find. When such a keyword is specified, then only events including this word or phrase in their sport names, event names, or usernames of the sporting officials will be retrieved and shown on the list. The search must ignore case sensitivity. For example, given the search keyword ‘semi’, Find will return all events that include the word ‘semi’ in their sport names, event names, or  sporting official usernames. Searching with a blank/empty keyword field will show all of the logged in user’s  associated events. Any search results returned must be ordered by sport name. 

## Adding an Event 
Users may also add a new event by clicking on the Add Event tab in the title bar, entering event details in the popup dialog that appears, and then clicking on Add Event button. User must enter a dash (‘-‘) as either the referee, judge, or medal giver if there is no sporting official allocated to that event for a particular role. 

## Updating an Event 
Users  can  also  update  an  event  by  modifying  data  in  the  event  details  screen  as  shown  in  Figure  5,  and clicking on Update Event button. You can access this update screen by clicking on an event from the list of events in the Events tab.
